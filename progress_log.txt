- 10.3 progress
- Added groundwork for towers and enemies
- Problems with git has taken most of my time, got it fixed on 9.3 and started to properly work on project.
- Time spent has been around 5 hours, would have done more work but other courses have taken too much time and solving problems in git took time.
- I am behind my schedule, but will hope to catch up this week.
